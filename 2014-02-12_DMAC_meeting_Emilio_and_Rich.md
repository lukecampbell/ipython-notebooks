## 2014-02-012 DMAC Webinar: IPython Notebooks, Wakari & IOOS
Rich and Emilio did demos using IPython Notebooks to search and access IOOS model and observational data. 
###Emilio's resources:
Instructions for building my Wakari environment, and a link to a Wakari notebook that bundles the environment (so you can install it easily):
