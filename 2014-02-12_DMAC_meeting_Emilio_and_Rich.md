## 2014-Feb-12 DMAC Webinar : IPython Notebooks, Wakari & IOOS

[Rich Signell](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs) and [Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom) did demos using IPython Notebooks to search and access IOOS model and observational data.  There was no powerpoint presentation and [the webex meeting](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ioos_tech/sY5I4cvzbS0/9JnwNHqd4D0J) was not recorded, but you can run all the notebooks shared below on Wakari for free, installing nothing, just using your web browser.  You might want to watch Rich's [short YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NyMWK4as-U) walking through the steps of loading a shared IPython notebook with environment into Wakari first.

###Rich's resources:
  Notebooks in the order I presented them:
* [IOOS Models displayed in Iris and using CSW to query (with environment)](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/rsignell/IOOS_Models-CSW)

###Emilio's resources:
* [Instructions for building my Wakari environment](https://github.com/ioos/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/creating_wakari_environments.md), and the [Wakari notebook that bundles the environment (so you can install it easily)](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/emayorga/pyoos_ioos_sos_demo1)
* The 4 Wakari-hosted notebooks I presented, in the order I presented them:
  1. [Using Pyoos to access Axiom 52North IOOS SOS "Stable Demo"](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/emayorga/pyoos_ioos_sos_demo1)
  2. [Access the operational NDBC SOS service with two methods: Pyoos NDBC SOS collector, and OWSLib/SOS](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/emayorga/ndbc_old_sos_pyoos_and_owslib_demo2)
  3. [Ingesting USGS data with ulmo via CUAHSI HIS Central](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/emayorga/ulmo_usgsdata_viacuahsi)
  4. [Use OWSLib to examine a DescribeSensor/SensorML response from IOOS SOS Milestone 1 (AOOS 52N SOS), then check vocabulary terms against MMI IOOS vocabularies](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/emayorga/ioossos_owslib_SensorML_MMIcheck_demo1_)
* [pyoos](https://github.com/asascience-open/pyoos) and [ulmo](http://ulmo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) sites and documentation
* [A tagged entry point to my github notebook gists](https://www.mygists.info/emiliom) (which mostly don't include the wakari notebooks)
